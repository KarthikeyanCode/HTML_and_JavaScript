        <p> 
            Pixel art is a different style of designing an art, where the amount of detail in an image is reduced where as it 
            gives different vibe when viewing the the image. The art style is incorporated in many video games. When it comes to
            video games this art is greatly appreciated by retro gamers as well as due to the less CPU and GPU usage for rendering
            the frames for the game.

        <p>
            Dead cells is a roguelike game with impressive graphic arts and fast impressive gamplay. The game starts with the player
            being able to control a character who can not die. The pixel art is incorporated into this game with very cool art style.
            First we get to see the cells healing and raising our character back to life. Then we get to go through the tutorial.
            After we finish the tutorial we get to know that we are in a prison and we are trying to escape. Each time we die, the 
            prison island kinda rearranges itself (as if its alive), so our map is different for each run. This makes the game very
            interesting.

            I am not an endgame player or a pro in videogames, but i enjoy them and i love the art, music and gameplay of dead cells.
            As we progress in game we get to understand the mechanics, we get to obtain upgrades, get new weapons from chests, unlock outfits,
            ingame money mechanics and lot more. The music is literally sick and suits the game environmnet to the maximum. As for the game
            weapon mechanics we have swords, bows, sheilds, magic stuff and lot more. The primary weapon can be anything and we get 3 extra 
            objects to take with us apart from 2 weapons. These objects can be used to deal damage, heal ourselves etc.

            If you are someone with very good reflexes in video games, then you are going to enjoy this game and be able to easily
            walkthrough it. It has bossfights, artifacts and upgrades each time we finish a stage. Maximum stage i have personally
            reached is the fractured shrines. I dont want to reveal any spoilers related to stages as that would ruin your game experience.
            Each stage i have played is absolutely awesome and has new enemies with new mechanics. It obviously gets tougher as we progress
            through stages, but its also true that we also will be able to make ourselves stronger through unlocks and new upgrades.

            Since the map is so vast for each stage, we have ports through which we can reach other ports instantaneously, like teleportation.
            We find weapons and other secrets in each stage, we can investigate these secrets to get weapons and stuff. Each stage has a story to it
            which we come to know each time we enter a stage. We get hints about what that stage is about and its backstory. The dodge mechanics is simple
            with rolling animation. We also unlock permanent runes which gives us a permanent ability.
